# Lewis Dot Structure

Lewis dot structure is a way to represent the bonding and lone pairs of electrons in a pictorial form. The [[Valence Electrons]] form bonds while the electrons that don't take part in making bonds remain separate and are called lone pairs.

## Rules for making lewis dot structures

### Octet Rule
Elements gain, lose or share electrons to achieve a configuration in which they are surrounded by eight valence electrons. Some elements can ignore this rule. They are said to be hypervalent.

### Formal Charge
Formal charge is the difference between the number of valence electrons and the number of electrons surrounding an atom in a particular Lewis structure.

${FC = VE - LPE - (BE)/2}$
