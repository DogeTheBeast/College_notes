# Mutability and Immutability

**Mutable** - Prone or liable to change.

```java

int x = 10;
```

- The value of *x* is mutable.
- The value of *10* is not mutable as it is an absolute number.


### Immutability

```java 
private final int id;
```

- The keyword *final* disables the user from the changing the value of variable *id*.
- If the variable *id* is assigned a value for a second time, it returns a compiler error.

Java *String* objects are immutable
