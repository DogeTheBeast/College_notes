# Removing noise

## Decoupling input from output
- have reference 0 and 1 outputs
- use input to switch between them
- no input means output does not have noise at all.


### Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) and Field effect transistors (FET)

when there is current flowing into the source, the gate forms an electric field (because the gate is polarised) letting
