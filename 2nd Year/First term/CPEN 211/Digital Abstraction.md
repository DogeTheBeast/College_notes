# Digital Abstraction

### Analog Approach
Use voltage to directly encode information. The problem with this approach is the existence of noise and not being able to remove noise.

### Digital binary
Only 2 states exist (High and Low). Less possible states but also removes noise from the system.

### Buffer
Takes an input and turns it into a digital binary signal. Able to remove noise from the signal.
