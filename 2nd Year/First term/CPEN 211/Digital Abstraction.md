# Digital Abstraction

### Analog Approach
Use voltage to directly encode information. The problem with this approach is the existence of noise and not being able to remove noise.

### Digital binary
Only 2 states exist (High and Low). Less possible states but also removes noise from the system.

### Buffer
Takes an input and turns it into a digital binary signal. Able to remove noise from the signal.

### Noise accumulation

The more analog circuits we combine the more noise accumulation impacts the output of the circuit. 
To fix this, we can add buffers after every time noise is added to the circuit. Hence, digital binary systems are easily scalable.
