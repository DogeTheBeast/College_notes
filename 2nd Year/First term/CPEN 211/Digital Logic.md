# Digital Logic


## Sequential Logic
Sequential logic can remember things.
- Needs storage for memory.
- output is a function of current inputs and current state. 
- Synchronous sequential logic: storage updated every time a clock ticks and the computation is conducted when the clock strikes.



## Combinational (memoryless function) Logic
Combinational Logic can not remember things but can compute stuff. Similar to a function, it performs calculations but does not depend upon the previous inputs.

- Present output is a function of present input
- Past input values do not matter
- Can be defined by a lookup table
