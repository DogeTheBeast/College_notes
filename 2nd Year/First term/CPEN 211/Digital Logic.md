# Digital Logic


## Sequential Logic
Sequential logic can remember things.
- Needs storage for memo



## Combinational (memoryless function) Logic
Combinational Logic can not remember things but can compute stuff. Similar to a function, it performs calculations but does not depend upon the previous inputs.

- Present output is a function of present input
- Past input values do not matter
- Can be defined by a lookup table
