# Activity

To take the ln of *K* and *Q*, *K* and *Q* must be dimensionless.
That is not always the case with them because they are raised to the power of their stociometric coefficients and the dimensions don't necessarily cancel out. Therefore, we measure *K* and *Q* in terms of **Activity**.

**Activity** reflects the real availability or "effective concentration" of a species in a real solution. The activities for all compounds in different states of matter are shown below,
