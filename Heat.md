# Heat
Heat is the amount of energy that flows between 2 bodies due to difference in [[Temperature]].

# Specific Heat Capacity

Specific Heat Capacity is the amount of energy required to increase the temperature of a material of unit mass by 1 degree C or K.

${Q = mc\Delta T}$

The units for c are ${\frac{J}{kg K}}$
