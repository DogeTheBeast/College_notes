# Force vector directed along a line ([[Dot Product]])

The force along a line or a direction is determined using the formula,

$${\LARGE \it{A}_u = A cos(\theta)}$$

$${\LARGE \bf{A}_u = \it{A} cos(\theta) \bf{u}}$$

$${\LARGE \it{A}_u = \bf{A} \cdot \bf{u}}$$

$${\LARGE \bf{A}_u = (\bf{A} \cdot \bf{u})\bf{u}}$$

# Moment vector directed along a line

The moment vector can be projected onto any axis using the formula,

$${\LARGE M_a = \bf{u}_a \cdot \bf{M}_O = \bf{u}_a \cdot (\bf{r} \times \bf{F})}$$

$${\LARGE \bf{M}_a = \it{M}_a \bf{u}_a = [\bf{u}_a \cdot (\bf{r} \times \bf {F})]\bf{u}_a}$$
