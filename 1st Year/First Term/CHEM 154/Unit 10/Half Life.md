# Half Life

Half life is the amount of time that it takes for the concentration of a reactant to become *half* of its initial concentration. This is dependent upon 3 factors,

-  **Order of Reaction**,
-  **Rate Consant**,
-  **Initial Concentration** of the reactant.


## Zeroth Order Reaction

$${\LARGE t_{1/2} = \frac{[A]_0}{2k}}$$

## First Order Reaction

$${\LARGE t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{k}}$$

## Second Order Reaction

$${\LARGE t_{1/2} = \frac{1}{k[A]_0}}$$

Only applicable if the concentration of all the reactants is the same as *A* and the rate law is,
$${Rate = k[A]^2}$$
