### Clarify Objective

The objective of the experiment is to measure the spring constant of a spring using the tools provided. Spring constant is the amount of force required to extend a spring by a unit length.

### Relate Quantities and forming relationship

#### Static method

Relate the force experienced by the spring and the extension of the spring

$${\LARGE F = -k \Delta x}$$
$${\LARGE (m_2 - m_1)g = -k (x_2 - x_1)}$$
$${\LARGE k = - \frac{(m_2 - m_1)\times g}{(x_2 - x_1)}}$$

#### Uncertainty of k

$${\LARGE \delta k =  k \times \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{\delta m_2^2 - \delta m_1^2}}{(m_2 - m_1)}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{\delta x_2^2 - \delta x_1^2}}{(x_2 - x_1)}\right)^2}}$$

### Procedure

1. Measure the mass of the spring before placing any mass on it.
2. Using the ruler to measure the length of the spring.
3. Add the mass on the spring and wait for it to stop oscillating. When the spring stop moving measure the mass of the setup.
4. With the mass on the spring, measure the length of the spring.
5. Use the equatio
