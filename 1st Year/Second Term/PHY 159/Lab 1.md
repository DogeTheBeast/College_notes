### Clarify Objective

The objective of the experiment is to measure the spring constant of a spring using the tools provided. Spring constant is the amount of force required to extend a spring by a unit length.

### Relate Quantities and forming relationship

#### Static method

Relate the force experienced by the spring and the extension of the spring

$${\LARGE F = -k \Delta x}$$
$${\LARGE (m_2 - m_1)g = -k (x_2 - x_1)}$$
$${\LARGE k = - \frac{(m_2 - m_1)\times g}{(x_2 - x_1)}}$$

#### Uncertainty of k

$${\LARGE \delta k =  k \times \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{\delta m_2^2 - \delta m_1^2}}{(m_2 - m_1)}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{\delta x_2^2 - \delta x_1^2}}{(x_2 - x_1)}\right)^2}}$$
