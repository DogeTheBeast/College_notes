## Expected Behavior

Expected voltage divider of the ratio of 1/2.

## Observed Behavior

The voltmeter shows 2.57 for the resistance of the resistor instead of 4.5 Volts.


## Generate Causes
Wiring issues, 

## Testing

Check wiring and connectivity, CHeck the resistance of the resistors.

## Repair and Evaluate
Change the resistance of the resistor from 1 ohm to 1 kilo ohm.
