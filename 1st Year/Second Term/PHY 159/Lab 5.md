## Objective
We will measure the speed of sound and the pressure amplitude inside an open pipe using the frequency of different waves.
1) Determine the speed of sound inside a tube.
2) Measure the pressure amplitude profile, *P(x)*, of the sounds waves inside the tube for the fundamental and the second resonance frequency.

## Clarify Objective
Sound travels in the form of waves. Sound waves are movement of air particles in back and forth direction which carries energy through the air and is heard as sound by the listener. The pressure in the wave is the pressure of the air particles that strikes the microphone which is similar to the volume of the sound. The fundamental frequency is the frequency at which the pressure in the tube at the ends is uniform and is maximum in the middle. 


The sound amplitude profile can be measured by measuring the slope of the sound wave inside the tube. The ends of the tube will have the minimum pressure change but in the middle of the tube, the pressure will be maximum, for the fundamental frequency. Over time, the pressure at the middle of the tube will oscillate with the same amplitude as the maximum pressure but the frequency of the oscillation will be the same as the frequency of the sound traveling through the tube.

Microphone: It measures the air pressure and displays it through the oscilloscope
