# Waves

## Superposition



When two waves with the same frequency interfere, superposition occurs. Superposition is the arithmetic sum of the amplitudes of the two waves meet at a point in space. There are 2 types of superpositions.

## Traveling waves

Traveling waves can be expressed using a standard equation,

$${\LARGE y_1(r_1,t) = A_1 sin(k(r_1 -vt) + \phi) = A_1 sin(kr_1 - \omega t + \phi)}$$

where,
${y_1}$ is the amplitude of the wave at time *t* and at a distance of ${r_1}$ from the source,
${A_1}$ is the maximum amplitude of the wave,
*k* is the same
