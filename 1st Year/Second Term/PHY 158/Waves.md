# Waves

## Superposition



When two waves with the same frequency interfere, superposition occurs. Superposition is the arithmetic sum of the amplitudes of the two waves meet at a point in space. There are 2 types of superpositions.

## Traveling waves

Traveling waves can be expressed using a standard equation,

$${\LARGE y_1(r_1,t) = A_1 sin(k(r_1 -vt) + \phi)}$$
