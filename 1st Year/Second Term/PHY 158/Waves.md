# Waves

## Superposition



When two waves with the same frequency interfere, superposition occurs. Superposition is the arithmetic sum of the amplitudes of the two waves meet at a point in space. There are 2 types of superpositions.

## Traveling waves

Traveling waves can be expressed using a standard equation,

$${\LARGE y_1(r_1,t) = A_1 sin(k(r_1 -vt) + \phi) = A_1 sin(kr_1 - \omega t + \phi)}$$

where,
*${y_1}$* is the amplitude of the wave at time *t* and at a distance of *${r_1}$* from the source,
*${A_1}$* is the maximum amplitude of the wave,
*k* is the wave number of the wave,
*v* is the speed of the wave, and
*${\phi}$* is the phase difference of the wave.

In superposition, the equations of two traveling waves can be combined,

$${\LARGE y_2(r_2,t) = A_2 sin(k(r_2 -vt) + \phi) = A_2 sin(kr_2 - \omega t + \phi)}$$

$${\LARGE y_T = y_1 + y_2}$$ 

$${\LARGE y_T (r_1,r_2,t) = A_1 sin(kr_1 - \omega t + \phi_1) + A_2 sin(kr_2 - \omega t + \phi_2)}$$

Using the equation above and trigonometric identities, it can be simplified into,

$${\LARGE y_{total} = 2A sin \left(\frac{k(r_1+r_2)}{2} - \omega t + \frac{\phi_1+\phi_2}{2}\right)cos\left(\frac{k(r_1-r_2) + \phi_1-\phi_2}{2}\right)}$$

The sin component describes the wave and the cos component describes the amplitude modulation. Hence, the ${\delta r}$ and ${\delta \phi}$ affect the amplitude and it is independent of time.
