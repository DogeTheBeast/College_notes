# Input and Output

## printf and its variations

*printf* is a function used to output text. When using *printf*, the variable that is going to be printed is represented by a placeholder. For example

```c

int a = 10;
printf("%o", a);



```

The term inside the double quotes is the placeholder and it replaces its value with the variable present after the comma. The *%o* gives the type of output it presents. This can be changed to present the variable as different datatypes.

### The Variations

These are the arguments that can go inside the double quotes in the printf statement.

| Argument | Datatype  |
| -------- | --------- |
| %c       | Character |
|          |           |
