# Numbers in Different Bases


## Converting from any base to decimal

A number always has a base that it has been written down in. For example,

$${ (10110)_2 = 1(2^4) + 0(2^3) + 1 (2^2) + 1(2^1_)  + 0(2^0) = (22)_{10}}$$

This can be generalized for any base. Consider the base of the system to be *x* for a a set of digits ${(y_(n-1),y_(n-2),...,y_2,y_1,y_0)*, therefore

$${\LARGE (y_{(n-1)},y_{(n-2)},...,y_1,y_0)_x = y_{(n-1)}(x^{n-1}) +y_{(n-2)}(x^{n-2})+...+y_1(x^{1}) + y_0(x^0) =}$$

Here, *abcd* can be of any length and the value of the power of x will change accordingly. This method will give you the number in decimal from any number system.
