# Numbers in Different Bases


## Converting from any base to decimal

A number always has a base that it has been written down in. For example,

$${ (10110)_2 = 1(2^4) + 0(2^3) + 1 (2^2) + 1(2^1)  + 0(2^0) = (22)_{10}}$$

This can be generalized for any base. Consider the base of the system to be *x* for a a set of digits ${(y_{(n-1)},y_{(n-2)},...,y_1,y_0)}$ with the number of digits being *n*, therefore

$${\LARGE (y_{(n-1)},y_{(n-2)},...,y_1,y_0)_x = y_{(n-1)}(x^{n-1}) +y_{(n-2)}(x^{n-2})+...+y_1(x^{1}) + y_0(x^0)}$$

This method will give you the number in decimal from any number system.


## Converting from decimal to any base

To convert from decimal to any number system, the following can be used.

The example above is for binary to decimal but this can be applied for any base by replace 2 with the desired number system.
