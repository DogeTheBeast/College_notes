# Numbers in Different Bases


## Converting form any base to decimal

A number always has a base that it has been written down in. For example,

$${ (10110)_2 = 1(2^4) + 0(2^3) + 1 (2^2) + 1(2^1_)  + 0(2^0) = (22)_{10}}$$

This can be generalized for any base. Consider the base of the system to be *x* for a a set of digits *abcd*, therefore

$${(abcd)_x = a(x^3) +b(x^2)+c(x^1)+d(x^0) = (efgh)_{10}}$$

Here, *abcd* can be of any length and the value of the power of x will change accordingly. This method will give you the number in decimal from any number system.
