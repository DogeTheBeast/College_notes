# Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR)

VSEPR is a theory that predicts molecular shape by treating atoms in a molecule as point charges that are favoured to be as far awat from each other as possible.

## Perspective Diagram
A perspective diagram is a 3 dimensional representation of a molecule in space. A solid wedge bond represents an atom coming out of the plane of the molecule. A dash bond represents an atom going into the plane of the molecule.
