# Vectors

Vectors are variables with a magnitude as well as a direction.

They are denoted by **A** or *${\vec{A}}$*.

The magnitude of a vector is denoted by *A* or |*${\vec{A}}$*|.

## Scalar Notation
If **F** is a vector in some arbitrary direction, then

${F_x = F cos(\theta)}$
${F_y = F sin(\theta)}$

${\theta}$ is the angle between **F** and the positive x-axis.
