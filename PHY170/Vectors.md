# Vectors

Vectors are variables with a magnitude as well as a direction.

They are denoted by **A** or *${\vec{A}}$*.

The magnitude of a vector is denoted by *A* or |*${\vec{A}}$*|.

## Scalar Notation
If **F** is a vector in some arbitrary direction, then

$${\LARGE F_x = F cos(\theta)}$$
$${\LARGE F_y = F sin(\theta)}$$

${\theta}$ is the angle between **F** and the positive x-axis.

## Cartesian Notation
Defining vectors using *unit vectors* in x, y and z axis. Unit vectors are denoted by ${\hat{i}}$ or *${\vec{i}}$* or **i**.

## Resultant force

$${F_{Rx} = \sum{F_x}}$$
$${F_{Ry} = \sum{F_y}}$$
 
 The resultant is the sum of the all the components of all the vectors acting at one point.
 
 ## Magnitude 
  The magnitude of a vector is the root of the square sum of the components of the vector.
  
  $${\LARGE F_R = \sqrt{F_{Rx}^2 + F_{Ry}^2}}$$
  
  ## Angle between the vector and the x-axis
  
  The angle between the vector and the positive x-axis is given by,
  
  $${\LARGE \theta = tan^{-1}|\frac{F_{Ry}}{F_{Rx}}|}$$
  
  ## Unit Vector
  
  Unit vector is a vector in an arbitrary direction with the magnitude of 1. It is denoted by **u**.
  
  $${\LARGE \textbf{u}_A = \frac{\textbf{A}}{\vec{A}}}$$
  
  $${\LARGE \vec{A} = |A|\hat{u}_A}$$
