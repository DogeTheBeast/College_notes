# Force vector directed along a line ([[Dot Product]])

The force along a line or a direction is determined using the formula,

$${\LARGE \it{A}_u = A cos(\theta)}$$

$${\LARGE \bf{A}_u = \it{A} cos(\theta) \bf{u}}$$

$${\LARGE \it{A}_u = \bf{A} \cdot \bf{u}}$$

$${\LARGE \bf{A}_u = (\bf{A} \cdot \bf{u})\bf{u}}$$
