# Moment of a Couple
## Couple
Two parallel forces that have the same magnitude, opposite directions, and which are separated by a perpendicular distance *d*. The resultant force due to a couple is 0, so only effect of couple is to produce rotation or tendency for rotation in some direction.

### Couple moment
The moment produced by a couple. 

Couple moment is independent of where moments are computed about. Since, a couple moment is independent of the point that we choose to compute moments, it can be viewed as a free vector.

Hence, moment can be computed by doing,

$${\LARGE \bf{M} = \bf{r} \times \bf{F}}$$

![[couple moment at any point.png]]
 The moment can be computed from the point *A* instead of *O*. Hence, **r** is an arbitrary vector from the line of action of -**F** to line of action of **F**.
 
### Equivalent couples
Two couples are equivalent if they produce the same moment. Since direction of couple moment is always perpendicular to place containing two forces defining the couple,equivalent couples must either lie in the same place, or in planes that are parallel to one another.

$${\bf{M}_R = \bf{M}_1 + \bf{M}_2}$$
