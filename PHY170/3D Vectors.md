# 3D Vectors
## Components of a 3D vector

### Cartesian Form ([[Vectors]])
$${\textbf{A} = A_x\hat{\textbf{i}}+ A_y\hat{\textbf{j}}+}{A_z\hat{\textbf{k}}}$$

### Coordinate direction angles of a Cartesian Vector

$${\LARGE \alpha, \beta, \gamma}$$

These are angles which are measured between the tail of the vector and the positive x, y and z axes located at the tail.

$${\LARGE cos(\alpha) = \frac{\bf{A_x}}{A}}$$
$${cos(\beta) = \frac{\bf{A_y}}{A}}$$
$${cos(\gamma) = \frac{\bf{A_z}}{A}}$$

$${\LARGE}$$
