# 3D Vectors
## Components of a 3D vector

### Cartesian Form ([[Vectors]])
${\textbf{A} = A_x\hat{\textbf{i}}+ A_y\hat{\textbf{j}}+}$${A_z\hat{\textbf{k}}}$

### Coordinate direction angles of a Cartesian Vector

${\alpha, \beta, \gamma}$

These are angles which are measured between the tail of the vector and the positive x, y and z axes located at the tail.

${cos(\alpha) = \frac{\bf{A_x}}{A}}$
