# Moment/Torque

Moment of a force about a point or axis provides a measure of the tendency of the force to cause a body to rotate about the point or axis. The SI unit of moments: ${N \cdot m}$

It is a vector and the larger the force or the greater the perpendicular distance from the axis, the greater the turning effect.

$${\LARGE M_O = Fd}$$

where,
${M_O}$ is the moment of the arm,
${F}$ is the magnitude of the force, and 
${d}$ is known as the moment arm (it is the perpendicular distance to the axis).

Moment is perpendicular to plane containing ${\bf{F}}$ and ${d}$.

## Direction of Moment

The direction of moment is determined using the right hand thumb rule. The forces rotating the body in an anti-clockwise direction are positive and vice-versa. The thumb points in the direction of moment.
