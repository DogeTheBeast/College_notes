# Moment/Torque

Moment of a force about a point or axis provides a measure of the tendency of the force to cause a body to rotate about the point or axis. The SI unit of moments: ${N \cdot m}$

It is a vector and the larger the force or the greater the perpendicular distance from the axis, the greater the turning effect.

$${\LARGE M_O = Fd}$$

where,
${M_O}$ is the moment of the arm at any point *O*,
${F}$ is the magnitude of the force, and 
${d}$ is known as the moment arm (it is the perpendicular distance to the axis).

Moment is perpendicular to plane containing ${\bf{F}}$ and ${d}$.

## Moment of a force using [[Cross Product]]

Moment of force **F** about moment axis passing through *O* and perpendicular to plane containing *O* and **F** is given by

$${\LARGE \bf{M}_O = r \times F}$$

**r** is a position vector drawn from *O* to any point lying on the line of action of **F**.

The resultant of the moment is related to the forces acting on the body by the equation,

$${\LARGE \bf (M_R)_\it{O} = \sum{\bf{(r} \times \bf{F} )}}$$

## Direction of Moment

The direction of moment is determined using the right hand thumb rule. The forces rotating the body in an anti-clockwise direction are positive and vice-versa. The thumb points in the direction of moment.

## Magnitude of Moment

The magnitude of moment is given by (by using the magnitude of cross product),
$${\LARGE M_O = F rsin(\theta)}$$

which can be rewritten as,
$${\LARGE M_O = Fd}$$
