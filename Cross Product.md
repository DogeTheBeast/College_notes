# Cross Product
Cross product is the product of 2 vectors which gives another vector perpendicular to the first 2 vectors.

$${\LARGE \bf{C} = \bf{A} \times \bf{B}}$$

$${\LARGE C = AB sin(\theta)}$$

$${\LARGE \bf{C} = (\it{AB}sin(\theta))\bf{u}_c}$$

where 
${\bf{u}_c}$ is the unit vector in the direction of C.


$${A \times B = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\bf{i} &\bf{j} &\bf{k}\\
\it A_x & A_y & A_z \\
B_x & B_y & B_z
\end{vmatrix}
}$$
