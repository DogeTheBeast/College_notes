# Electronegativity

Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract shared electrons to itself in a chemical bond. 

${Greater Electronegativity = Greater affinity}$

It is not an atomic property because it refers to atoms in a bond and it is a calculated value, not measured. The greater the electronegativty
