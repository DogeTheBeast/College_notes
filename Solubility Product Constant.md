# Solubility Product Constant (${K_{sp}}$)


When a slightly soluble ionic compound is added to water, some of it dissolves to form a solution, establishing an equilibrium between the pure solid and a solution of its ions. The *Equilibrium Constant* for the dissolving ionic compound is known as *Solubility Product Constant*.

$${\LARGE K_{sp} = [Ions]^{Stociome}}
