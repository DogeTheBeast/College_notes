# Solubility Product Constant (${K_{sp}}$)


When a slightly soluble ionic compound is added to water, some of it dissolves to form a solution, establishing an equilibrium between the pure solid and a solution of its ions. The *Equilibrium Constant* for the dissolving ionic compound is known as *Solubility Product Constant*.

Calcium oxalate monohydrate [Ca(O2CCO2)·H2O, also written as CaC2O4·H2O] is a sparingly soluble salt that is the other major component of kidney stones [along with Ca3(PO4)2]. Its solubility in water at 25°C is 7.36 × 10−4 g/100 mL. Calculate its _K_sp.

**Given:** solubility in g/100 mL

**Asked for:** _K_sp

**Strategy:**

1.  Write the balanced dissolution equilibrium and the corresponding solubility product expression.
2.  Convert the solubility of the salt to moles per liter. From the balanced dissolution equilibrium, determine the equilibrium concentrations of the dissolved solute ions. Substitute these values into the solubility product expression to calculate _K_sp.

**Solution**

**A** We need to write the solubility product expression in terms of the concentrations of the component ions. For calcium oxalate monohydrate, the balanced dissolution equilibrium and the solubility product expression (abbreviating oxalate as ox2−) are as follows:

Ca(O2CCO2)⋅H2O(s)⇌Ca2+(aq)+−O2CCO−2(aq)+H2O(l)Ksp=[Ca2+][ox2−]

Neither solid calcium oxalate monohydrate nor water appears in the solubility product expression because their concentrations are essentially constant.

**B** Next we need to determine [Ca2+] and [ox2−] at equilibrium. We can use the mass of calcium oxalate monohydrate that dissolves in 100 mL of water to calculate the number of moles that dissolve in 100 mL of water. From this we can determine the number of moles that dissolve in 1.00 L of water. For dilute solutions, the density of the solution is nearly the same as that of water, so dissolving the salt in 1.00 L of water gives essentially 1.00 L of solution. Because each 1 mol of dissolved calcium oxalate monohydrate dissociates to produce 1 mol of calcium ions and 1 mol of oxalate ions, we can obtain the equilibrium concentrations that must be inserted into the solubility product expression. The number of moles of calcium oxalate monohydrate that dissolve in 100 mL of water is as follows:

7.36×10−4 g146.1 g/mol=5.04×10−6 mol Ca(O2CCO2)⋅H2O

The number of moles of calcium oxalate monohydrate that dissolve in 1.00 L of the saturated solution is as follows:

(5.04×10−6 mol Ca(O2CCO2⋅)H2O100 mL)(1000 mL1.00 L)=5.04×10−5 mol/L=5.04×10−5 M

Because of the stoichiometry of the reaction, the concentration of Ca2+ and ox2− ions are both 5.04 × 10−5 M. Inserting these values into the solubility product expression,

Ksp=[Ca2+][ox2−]=(5.04×10−5)(5.04×10−5)=2.54×10−9(9.7.4)

In our calculation, we have ignored the reaction of the weakly basic anion with water, which tends to make the actual solubility of many salts greater than the calculated value.
