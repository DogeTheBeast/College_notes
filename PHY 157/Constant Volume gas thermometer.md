# Constant Volume gas thermometer

A constant volume gas thermometer is a thermometer in the shape of a sphere which contains a constant volume of a gas. The sphere is placed inside a liquid and is allowed to reach [[Thermal Equilibrium]]. The temperature of the liquid is measured by measuring the [[Pressure]] inside the thermometer using a pressure gauge.

## How to use a CVGT 

The CVGT is defined by the equation
${T = constant \times P}$

Hence, P is the reading that we obtain from the thermometer. The constant is determined by testing it against the temperature at the triple point of water.

${constant = \frac{T_{triple-point}}{P_{triple-point}}}$
