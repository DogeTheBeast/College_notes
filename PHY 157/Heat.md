# Heat
Heat is the amount of energy that flows between 2 bodies due to difference in [[Temperature]].

# Specific Heat Capacity (Molar Heat Capacity)

Specific Heat Capacity is the amount of energy required to increase the temperature of a material of unit mass by 1 degree C or K.

${Q = mc\Delta T}$

The units for c are ${\frac{J}{kg.K}}$

This value differs for different materials because in more complicated, part of energy added goes to rotations/vibrations and etc.., so it takes more Q to increase the internal energy.


The same principle can be used for Molar heat capacity, by replacing the mass with the number of moles. 
${Q = nc \Delta T}$

The units for c are ${\frac{J}{mol.K}}$


# Heat Capacity
Heat Capacity is the amount of energy required to increase the temperature of a body of a specific mass by 1 degree C or K. It differs from specific heat capacity because specific heat capacity is for *unit mass* but Heat capacity is for a specific body with a mass with isn't necessarily 1.

${Q = C\Delta T}$


# Latent Heat

Latent heat is the amount of energy required to change the phase of a material of unit mass. There are 2 types of latent heat
- Latent heat of fusion which is the change in phase between solid and liquid.
- Latent heat of vaporization which is the change in phase between liquid and gas.

${Q = mL}$

Where L is either the latent heat of fusion ()
