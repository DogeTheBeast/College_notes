# Thermal Radiation

The thermal radiation from an object is released in a mix of electromagnetic waves which can be shown by the diagram,

![[Thermal Radiation.png]]

The area underneath the graph gives the total power emitted by the body. This can be used to calculate the amount of power released for a specific wavelength. 
As the temperature increases, the intensity of the wavelength increases.

## Emissivity and Black Body
Emissivity (denoted by *e*) is defined as the ratio of the energy radiated from a material's surface to that radiated from a perfect emitter, known as a blackbody, at the same temperature and wavelength and under the same viewing conditions.

For substances which act as black bodies, the emissivity is 1 and for white bodies (which radiate no energy), the emissivity is 0.

## Peak Wavelength

The peak wavelength is the wavelength where the graph has the greatest intensity. As seen from the graph above, as the temperature increases, the peak wavelength decreases.

$${\LARGE \lambda_{peak} \propto \frac{1}{T}}$$

## Wien's Displacement law

Wien's displacement law states that black-body radiation curve will peak at different wavelengths that are inversely proportional to the temperature, as stated above.

$${\LARGE \lambda_{peak} = \frac{b}{T}}$$

where b is the Wien's displacement constant,

$${b = 2.897771955 \times 10^{−3} m \cdot K}$$

## Stefan-Boltzmann's Law

Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the total power (heat) from thermal radiation is proportional to temperature raised to the power of 4.

$${\LARGE H \propto T^4}$$

This law can be elaborated into,

$${\LARGE H = Ae\sigma T^4}$$
where *H* is the heat released,
*A* is the surface area of the body,
*e* is the emissivity of the body,
*T* is the temperature of the body, and
${\sigma}$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, which is

$${\sigma = 5.670374419×10^{−8} W\cdot m^{−2}\cdot K^{−4}}$$

If the body is placed in surroundings with the temperature ${T_S}$, then,

$${\LARGE H_{net} = H_{emit} - H_{abs}}$$

and therefore, 
$${\LARGE H_{net} = Ae \sigma (T^4 - T_S^4)}$$

where, *T* is the temperature of the body, and
${T_S}$ is the temperature of the surroundings.

### Steady state heat flow

$${\LARGE H_{in} = H_{out}}$$


## Albedo

Albedo is the overall average reflection coefficient for solar radiation incident on an object. Albedo of the Earth is about 0.3 which means that the Earth as a whole reflects 30% of solar radiation.
