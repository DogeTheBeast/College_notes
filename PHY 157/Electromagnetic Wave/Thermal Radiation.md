# Thermal Radiation

The thermal radiation from an object is released in a mix of electromagnetic waves which can be shown by the diagram,

The area underneath the graph gives the total power emitted by the body. This can be used to calculate the amount of power released for a specific wavelength. 
As the temperature increases, the intensity of the wavelength increases.

## Emissivity and Black Body
Emissivity (denoted by *e*) is defined as the ratio of the energy radiated from a material's surface to that radiated from a perfect emitter, known as a blackbody, at the same temperature and wavelength and under the same viewing conditions.

For substances which act as black bodies, the emissivity is 1 and for white bodies (which radiate no energy), the emissivity is 0.

## Peak Wavelength

The peak wavelength is the wavelength where the graph has the greatest intensity. As seen from the graph above, as the temperature increases, the peak wavelength decreases.

$${\LARGE \lambda_{peak} \propto \frac{1}{T}}$$

## Wien's Displacement law

Wien's displacement law states that black-body radiation curve will peak at different wavelengths that are inversely proportional to the temperature, as stated above.

$${\LARGE \lambda_{peak} = \frac{b}{T}}$$

where b is the Wien's displacement constant,

$${\LARGE b = 2.897771955 \times 10^{âˆ’3} m \cdot K}$$

## Stefan-Boltzmann's Law

Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the total power from thermal radiation is proportional to temperature raised to the power of 4.

$${\LARGE P \propto T^4}$$

This law can be elaborated into,

$${\LARGE P = Ae\sigma T^4}$$
where *P* is the power released,
*A* is the surface area of the body,
*e* is the emissivity of the body,
*T* is the temperature of the body, and
${\sigma}$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant
