# Thermal Radiation

The thermal radiation from an object is released in a mix of electromagnetic waves which can be shown by the diagram,

The area underneath the graph gives the total power emitted by the body. This can be used to calculate the amount of power released for a specific wavelength. 
As the temperature increases, the intensity of the wavelength increases.

## Emissivity and Black B




## Peak Wavelength

The peak wavelength is the wavelength where the graph has the greatest intensity. As seen from the graph above, as the temperature increases, the peak wavelength decreases.

$${\LARGE \lambda_{peak} \propto \frac{1}{T}}$$

## Wien's Displacement law

Wien's displacement law states that black-body radiation curve will peak at different wavelengths that are inversely proportional to the temperature, as stated above.

$${\LARGE \lambda_{peak} = \frac{b}{T}}$$

where b is the Wien's displacement constant,

$${\LARGE b = 2.897771955 \times 10^{âˆ’3} m \cdot K}$$
