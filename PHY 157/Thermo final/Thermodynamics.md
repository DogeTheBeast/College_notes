# Thermodynamics

## Laws of Thermodynamics
0. The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two thermodynamic systems are each in [[Thermal Equilibrium]] with a third system, then they are in [[Thermal Equilibrium]] with each other.
1. The first law of thermodynamics, also known as Law of Conservation of Energy, states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; energy can only be transferred or changed from one form to another.
2. The second law of thermodynamics says that the entropy of any isolated system always increases. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[Thermal Equilibrium]]—the state of maximum entropy of the system.
3. The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the [[Temperature]] approaches absolute zero.

## Temperature

Temperature is the measure of the random average [[kinetic energy]] of the molecules in an object.

### Different units for measuring temperature

- Celsius - Based on the boiling and melting point of water.
- Kelvin - 0 kelvin is the lowest possible temperature and the division between the temperatures is the same as celsius.
- Fahrenheit - 0 °F, was established as the freezing [[Temperature]] of a solution of brine made from a mixture of water, ice, and ammonium chloride (a salt).

### Conversion between different unites of temperature

$${\LARGE T_{kelvin} = T_{celsius} + 273.15}$$
$${\LARGE T_{fahrenheit} = \frac{9 \times T_{celsius}{5} + 32}$$
