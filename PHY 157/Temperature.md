# Temperature

Temperature is the measure of the random average [[kinetic energy]] of the molecules in an object.

## Different units for measuring temperature

- Celsius - Based on the boiling and melting point of water.
- Kelvin - 0 kelvin is the lowest possible temperature and the division between the temperatures is the same as celsius.
- Fahrenheit - 0 °F, was established as the freezing [[temperature]] of a solution of brine made from a mixture of water, ice, and ammonium chloride (a salt).

## Conversion between different unites of temperature

${T_kelvin = T_celsius + 273.15}$
${T_fahrenheit =9/5 ** T_celsius + 273.15}$
