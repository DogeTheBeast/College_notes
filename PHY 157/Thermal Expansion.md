# Thermal Expansion

The expansion of a body in terms of length or volume because of increase in [[Temperature]] is called thermal expansion. There are 2 types of thermal expansions.

- Linear Thermal Expansion - Expansion in only 1 dimension
- Volumetric Thermal Expansion - Expansion in 3 dimensions.

### Reason for expansion due to heating

## Linear Thermal Expansion
${\Delta L}$ is directly propertional to ${\Delta T}$.
${\Delta L}$ is also directly propertional to ${L_o}$.

${\Delta L = \alpha L_o \Delta T}$

where ${\alpha}$ is the coefficient of linear expansion with the units as ${K^{-1}}$. 
${\alpha}$ can depend upon temperature but the linear approximation is good over small temperature intervals.

## Volumetric Thermal Expansion

${\Delta V = \beta V_o \Delta T}$

where ${\beta}$ is the coefficient of volume expansion. It has the same units as ${\alpha}$ (${K^{-1}}$). This applies to solids as well as liquids.
