# Ideal Gas
Ideal gas is a theoretical gas model which can be used to approximate the behaviour of many gases under many conditions, although it has several limitations. The equation used for ideal gases is,

$${\LARGE PV  = nRT}$$
where, *P* is the pressure in *Pa* (Pascal),
*V* is the volume in ${m^3}$,
*n* is the number of moles of the gas,
*R* is the gas constant, and
*T* is the temperature of the gas.
${R = 8.314 J/mol \cdot K}$

## Postulates of the Ideal gas model

1. A gas is made up of a vast number of particles which are in constant random motion.
2. Gas particles occupy no volume.
3. Gas molecules move in straight lines except when they collide with other molecules or with the walls of the container. These collisions are elastic.
4. Gas molecules interact with one another only when collisions occur.
5. Average kinetic energy (KE) of gas molecules is proportional to the temperature.

## Charle's Law
Charle's law states that the volume and temperature of a gas are directly proportional for constant pressure and moles of gas.
$${\LARGE V \propto T}$$
## Boyle's Law
Boyle's law states that the volume and pressure of a gas are inversely proportional for constant moles and temperature.
$${\LARGE P \propto \frac{1}{V}}$$
## Avogadro's Law
Avogadro's law states that the volume and number of moles of a gas are directly proportional for constant pressure and temperature.
$${\LARGE V \propto n}$$
