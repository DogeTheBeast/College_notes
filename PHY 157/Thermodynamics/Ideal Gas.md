# Ideal Gas
Ideal gas is a theoretical gas model which can be used to approximate the behaviour of many gases under many conditions, although it has several limitations. The equation used for ideal gases is,

$${\LARGE PV  = nRT}$$
where, *P* is the pressure in *Pa* (Pascal),
*V* is the volume in ${m^3}$,
*n* is the number of moles of the gas,
*R* is the gas constant, and
*T* is the temperature of the gas.
${R = 8.314 J/mol \cdot K}$

## Charle's Law
Charle's law states that the volume and temperature of a gas are directly proportional.
$${\LARGE V \propto T}$$
## Boyle's Law
Boyle's law states that the volume and pressure of a gas are inversely proportional.
$${\LARGE P \propto \frac{1}{V}}$$
## Avogadro's Law
Avogadro's law states that the volume and temperature of a gas are directly proportional.
$${\LARGE V \propto T}$$
