# Temperature

Temperature is the measure of the random average [[kinetic energy]] of the molecules in an object.

## Different units for measuring temperature

- Celsius - Based on the boiling and melting point of water.
- Kelvin - 0 kelvin is the lowest possible temperature and the division between the temperatures is the same as celsius.
- Fahrenheit - 0 °F, was established as the freezing [[Temperature]] of a solution of brine made from a mixture of water, ice, and ammonium chloride (a salt).

## Conversion between different unites of temperature

${T_{kelvin} = T_{celsius} + 273.15}$
${T_{fahrenheit} =9/5 * T_{celsius} + 32}$
