# Cyclic Process

Cyclic processes are processes graphed on a x-y plane with Pressure on the y-axis and Volume on the x-axis.

# Internal Energy

Internal energy is the sum of the kinetic energy, rotational energy and vibrational energy of the molecules of the gas. Its a state variable

$${\LARGE \Delta U = nC_v \Delta T}$$
where, ${\Delta U}$ is the internal energy,
*n* is the number of the moles,
${C_v}$ is the molar specific heat, and
${\Delta T}$ is the change in temperature.

$${\LARGE U = \frac{3}{2} nRT}$$

$${\LARGE C_v = \frac{3}{2}R}$$
