# Cyclic Process

Cyclic processes are processes graphed on a x-y plane with Pressure on the y-axis and Volume on the x-axis.

The work done by a gas in a process is the area underneath the graph.

# Internal Energy

Internal energy is the sum of the kinetic energy, rotational energy and vibrational energy of the molecules of the gas. Its a state variable, meaning that *U* is independent of the path that it takes to go from one state to another, it only depends on initial and final state.

$${\LARGE \Delta U = nC_v \Delta T}$$
where, ${\Delta U}$ is the internal energy,
*n* is the number of the moles,
${C_v}$ is the molar specific heat, and
${\Delta T}$ is the change in temperature.

$${\LARGE U = \frac{3}{2} nRT}$$

$${\LARGE C_v = \frac{3}{2}R}$$

# Isochoric process
Isochoric processes are processes which occur with constant volume.

$${\LARGE W = 0}$$
$${\LARGE Q = \Delta U}$$

# Isobaric process
Isobaric processes are processes which occur with constant pressure.
![[isobaric process.jpg]]

$${\LARGE Q = \Delta U + W}$$
$${\LARGE Q = n C_p \Delta T}$$
$${\LARGE \Delta U = n C_v \Delta T}$$
$${\LARGE W = P \Delta V = n R \Delta T}$$

# Isothermal process
Isothermal processes are processes which occurs with constant temperature.

$${\LARGE \Delta U = 0}$$

# Adiabatic processes
Adiabatic processes are processes which occur when there is no change in the value of *Q*.
