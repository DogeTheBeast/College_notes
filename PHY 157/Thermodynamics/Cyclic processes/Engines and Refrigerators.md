### Overview

$${\LARGE e = 1- \frac{1}{r^{\gamma -1}}}$$
where, *r* is the compression ratio, and
${\gamma}$ is the adiabatic exponent.

### Engine Knocking

The greater the value of the compression ratio (*r*), the greater is the efficiency of the system. **BUT** if *r* is too high, the gasoline will spontaneously ignite. (**Engine Knocking**).

## Diesel Engines

Because there is no fuel in the cylinder during the compression stroke, pre-ignition cannot occur, and the compression ratio *r* can be much higher than for a gasoline engine.

# Refrigerators

A refrigerator takes heat from a cold place (inside the refrigerator) and gives it off to a warmer place (the room). It is essentially a heat engine operating in reverse.
