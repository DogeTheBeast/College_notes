# Thermal Conductivity

[[Heat]] current is the measure of the rate of flow of energy between 2 bodies at different [[Temperature]]. The unit of [[Heat]] current is ${J/s}$. It is measured using the equation

${H = kA\frac{T_H - T_C}{L}}$

where
*H* is the [[Heat]] current
*k* is the Thermal Conductivity of the material which is denoted by ${W/mK}$
*A* is the cross sectional area
*L* is the length or the thickness of the body conducting the [[Heat]].

# Thermal Resistance

Thermal resistance (R) is the measure of the effectiveness of insulation layer.

${R = \frac{L}{k}}$

Where L is the thickness,
and k is the thermal conductivity.

The larger the R value, the better insulation the material provides.
