# Thermal Conductivity

Heat current is the measure of the rate of flow of energy between 2 bodies at different [[Temperature]]. The unit of Heat current is ${J/s}$. It is measured using the equation

${H = kA\frac{T_H - T_C}{L}}$

where
*H* is the heat current
*k* is the Thermal Conductivity of the material which is denoted by ${W/mK}$
*A* is the cross sectional area
*L* is the length or the thickness of the body conducting the heat.

# Thermal Resistance

Thermal resistance is the measure of the effectiveness of insulation layer.
