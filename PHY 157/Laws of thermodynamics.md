# The 3 laws of thermodynamics

0. The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two thermodynamic systems are each in [[Thermal Equilibrium]] with a third system, then they are in [[Thermal Equilibrium]] with each other.
1. The first law of thermodynamics, also known as Law of Conservation of Energy, states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; energy can only be transferred or changed from one form to another.
2. The second law of thermodynamics says that the entropy of any isolated system always increases. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[Thermal Equilibrium]]â€”the state of maximum entropy of the system.
3. The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the [[Temperature]] approaches absolute zero.
