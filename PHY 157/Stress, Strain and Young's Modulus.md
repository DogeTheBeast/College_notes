# Stress

Stress is the change length of an object due to a force or strain applied to it. There are 2 types of stress - 

- Tensile Stress - It occuers when an object is stretched by forces acting at the ends.
- Compressive Stress - It occuers when an object is compressed by forces acting at the ends.

Stress is similar to [[Pascal]], meaning that it is measured using 
${Stress = \frac{F}{A}}$

and it has the same units as pressure
