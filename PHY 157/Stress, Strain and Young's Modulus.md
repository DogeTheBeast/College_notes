# Stress

Stress is the force per unit area applied on a body. There are 2 types of stress - 

- Tensile Stress - It occuers when an object is stretched by forces acting at the ends.
- Compressive Stress - It occuers when an object is compressed by forces acting at the ends.

Stress is similar to [[Pressure]], meaning that it is measured using 
${Stress = \frac{F}{A}}$

and it has the same units as [[Pressure]] ([[Pascal]]).


# Strain

Strain is the fractional change in length of an object due to a force or stress applied to it. It is dimensionless and is calculated using

${Strain = \frac{\Delta L}{L_o}}$

# Young's Modulus

The constant of propertionality used to relate Stress to Strain is called Young's modulus. It is denoted by ${Y}$. Itâ€™s a measure of how much [[Pressure]] is required to produce a significant fractional change in length.
${Y = \frac{Stress}{Strain} = \frac{F/A}{\Delta L / L_o}}$
${\frac{F}{A} = Y \frac{\Delta L}{L_o}}$
