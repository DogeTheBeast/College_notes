# Orbitals

The quantum mechanical model of an atom or molecule states that the position of an electron cannot be known with absolute certainty. For this reason, the position of an electron is presented as aprobability distributionwhich wedescribe using orbitals. Orbitals are the regions in space where electrons can befound in a higher probability.
