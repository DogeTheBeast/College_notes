# Resonance Structures

Resonance structures are structures which can exist for a compound but the actual compound is in a state which is in the middle of the resonance structures. Resonance structures only differ from one another only in the placement of electrons, but all show the same arrangement of atoms themselves.

## Rules for drawing resonance structures
- only electrons can be moved - nuclei never move in resonance structures.
- Total number of electrons in system is constant, total charge in system is constant.
- All structures should be proper Lweis structures.
- Look for lone pairs and double-bond electrons. These move in resonance structures.
