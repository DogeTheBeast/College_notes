# Polarity

Because of the difference in electronegativity, electrons are never equally distributed when two different atoms bond. This charge separation is known as a dipole.

The polarity of a molecule is denoted by an arrow to show bond polarity. The arrow points to the electronegative element and the line to denote the electropositive element.

## Rules for identifying polar compounds
- There should be a dipole moment on the molecule.
- The vector addition of the dipole m
