# Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR)

VSEPR is a theory that predicts molecular shape by treating atoms in a molecule as point charges that are favoured to be as far awat from each other as possible.

## Perspective Diagram
A perspective diagram is a 3 dimensional representation of a molecule in space. A solid wedge bond represents an atom coming out of the plane of the molecule. A dash bond represents an atom going into the plane of the molecule.

## Guidelines

- You do not need to show lone pairs in VSEPR perspective diagrams.
- You do not need to draw multiple bonds in VSEPR perspective diagrams.

## Parent Shape and Molecular Shape

Parent shape is the shape of the compound including the lone pairs of electrons whereas the molecular shape is the shape of the compound based on the bonds only.

## Electron Repulsion

- LP-LP   Strongest repulsion
- LP-BP   Normal repulsion
- BP-BP   Weaker repulsion

"Bad" contacts are angles between bonds and lone pairs that are greater than 120 degrees. You want to minimize the strongest repulsion first and then go down the list.
