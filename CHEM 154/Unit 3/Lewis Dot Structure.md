# Lewis Dot Structure

Lewis dot structure is a way to represent the bonding and lone pairs of electrons in a pictorial form. The [[Valence Electrons]] form bonds while the electrons that don't take part in making bonds remain separate and are called lone pairs.

## Rules for making lewis dot structures

### Octet Rule
Elements gain, lose or share electrons to achieve a configuration in which they are surrounded by eight valence electrons. Some elements can ignore this rule. They are said to be hypervalent.

### Formal Charge
Formal charge is the difference between the number of valence electrons and the number of electrons surrounding an atom in a particular Lewis structure.

${FC = VE - LPE - (BE)/2}$

The most stable Lewis structure
- is the one with the least non-zero formal charges. 
- is the one with the negative charge on the most electronegative atom and positive charge on the least electronegative atom.

## Steps to draw a Lewis Structure

1. Count the number of Valence electrons in the molecule or ion.
2. Draw the skeletal strcuture of the molecule
	1. The least electronegative atom is generally the central atom.
	2. Hydrogen is always a terminal atom.
	3. Unless told otherwise, do not form rings.
3. Place two electrons in each bond of the skeletal structure.
4. Place the remaining valence electrons not accounted for in Step 2 as lone paiirs on individual atoms until the octet rule is satisfied.
5. Form multiple bonds as needed to complete octets and account for all valence electrons.
6. Label the formal charges. (The sum of the formal charges is equal to the overall molecular charge)



## Exceptions to the Octet Rule

### Sextet

Elements in the Group 13 sometimes follow a "sextet" rule which means that they only have 3 electron groups surrounding them.

### Radical Species

Molecules with an odd number of electrons will have an unpaired electron. These species are called radicals. Example,

### Hypervalence (Expanded Octet)
Elements on the third row of the periodic table and below can expand their octet. Terminal atoms are not hypervalent. Example,

# Resonance Structures

Resonance structures are structures which can exist for a compound but the actual compound is in a state which is in the middle of the resonance structures. Resonance structures only differ from one another only in the placement of electrons, but all show the same arrangement of atoms themselves.

## Rules for drawing resonance structures
- only electrons can be moved - nuclei never move in resonance structures.
- Total number of electrons in system is constant, total charge in system is constant.
- All structures should be proper Lweis structures.
- Look for lone pairs and double-bond electrons. These move in resonance structures.

# CHEM 154 Rules
- If multiple hypervalent resonance structures are possible, only those having positive or zero formal charges on the central atom are considered valid.
- Do not put a negative formal charge on the central atom unless you absolutely have to.
- You should never put a double bond on a halogen.
