# Lewis Dot Structure

Lewis dot structure is a way to represent the bonding and lone pairs of electrons in a pictorial form. The [[Valence Electrons]] form bonds while the electrons that don't take part in making bonds remain separate and are called lone pairs.

## Rules for making lewis dot structures

### Octet Rule
Elements gain, lose or share electrons to achieve a configuration in which they are surrounded by eight valence electrons. Some elements can ignore this rule. They are said to be hypervalent.

### Formal Charge
Formal charge is the difference between the number of valence electrons and the number of electrons surrounding an atom in a particular Lewis structure.

${FC = VE - LPE - (BE)/2}$

The most stable Lewis structure
- is the one with the least non-zero formal charges. 
- is the one with the negative charge on the most electronegative atom and positive charge on the least electronegative atom.


## Exceptions to the Octet Rule

### Sextet

Elements in the Group 13 sometimes follow a "sextet" rule which means that they only have 3 electron groups surrounding them.

### Radical Species

Molecules with an odd number of electrons will have an unpaired electron. These species are called radicals. Example,

### Hypervalence (Expanded Octet)
Elements on the third row of the periodic table and below can expand their octet. Terminal atoms are not hypervalent. Example,
