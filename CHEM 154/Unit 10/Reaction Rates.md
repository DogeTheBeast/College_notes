# Reaction Rates

The rate of reaction is the measure of the rate of *decrease in the concentration of the reactants* or the rate of *increase in the concentration of the products*.

$${\LARGE Rate = \frac{change\;in\;concentration}{elapsed\;time}}$$

The concentration chanes depend on stoichiometry,

$${\LARGE Rate = \frac{\Delta [product]}{v_{prod}\; \Delta t} = - \frac{\Delta [reactant]}{v_{react}\; \Delta t}}$$


Positive rate corresponds with formation of products and negative for depletion of reactants.

The rate of reaction can be determined from the change of any of the chemical species:

$$\ce{aA + bB -> cC + dD}$$

$${ Rate = -\frac{1}{a} \frac{\Delta [A]}{\Delta t} = -\frac{1}{b} \frac{\Delta [B]}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{c} \frac{\Delta [C]}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{d} \frac{\Delta [D]}{\Delta t}}$$
