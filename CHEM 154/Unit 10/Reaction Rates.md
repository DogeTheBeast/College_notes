# Reaction Rates

The rate of reaction is the measure of the rate of *decrease in the concentration of the reactants* or the rate of *increase in the concentration of the products*.

$${\LARGE Rate = \frac{change\;in\;concentration}{elapsed\;time}}$$

The concentration chanes depend on stoichiometry,

$${\LARGE Rate = \frac{\Delta [product]}{v_{prod}\; \Delta t} = - \frac{\Delta [reactant]}{v_{react}\; \Delta t}}$$


Positive rate corresponds with formation of products and negative for depletion of reactants.

The rate of reaction can be determined from the change of any of the chemical species:

$$\ce{aA + bB -> cC + dD}$$

$${ Rate = -\frac{1}{a} \frac{\Delta [A]}{\Delta t} = -\frac{1}{b} \frac{\Delta [B]}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{c} \frac{\Delta [C]}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{d} \frac{\Delta [D]}{\Delta t}}$$

# Rate Law

The reaction rate depends on the concentration of reactants and a rate constant.

$$\ce{A + B -> C}$$

The **Rate Law** is the equation that relates the *concentration of the reactants* and the *Rate constant (k)*. The rate law for the equation above is,

$${\LARGE Rate = k[A]^n [B]^m}$$

where, 
- *n* and *m* are referred to as the **order of the reaction**, and
- *k* is the **rate constant** which differes from reaction to reaction and for forward and reverse directions.

*k*, *n* and *m* are experimentally determined.


## Integrated Rate Law

**Integrated Rate Law** is used to determine the rate of formation of product at any point during the reaction. The integrated rate law depends on the order of the reaction and there are different equations for each order of reaction.

### Zeroth Order Reaction

$${\LARGE Rate = k[A]^0}$$

As the order of the reaction is 0,  the rate of the reaction is *independent of the  concentration of the reactant* and only dependent upon the *rate constant*. Therefore, by integrating the rate law, we get,

$${\LARGE [A]_t = [A]_0 \; - kt}$$

where,
- ${[A]_t}$ is the concentration of the reactant *A* at time *t*.
- ${[A]_0}$ is the initial concentration of the reactant *A*.
- *k* is the rate constant.
- *t* is the point in time for which we are trying to find the concentration.



### First Order Reaction

$${\LARGE Rate = k[A]}$$

As the order of the reaction is 1, the rate of the reaction is *directly proportional* to the concentration of the reactant *A*. Therefore, by integrating the rate law, we get,

$${\LARGE ln([A]_t) = ln([A]_0) - kt}$$

which can be simplified into,

$${\LARGE [A]_t = [A]_0\;e^{-kt}}$$

So, the concentration decays *exponentially* with time from the initial concentration to 0.


### Second Order Reaction

$${\LARGE Rate = k[A]^2}$$

As the order of the reaction is 2, the rate of the reaction is *directly propertional to the square of the concentration of the reactant A*. Therefore, by integrating the rate law, we get,

$${\LARGE \frac{1}{[A]_t} = \frac{1}{[A]_0} + kt}$$

which can be simplified into,
$${\LARGE [A]_t = \frac{[A]_0}{1+ [A]_0\; kt}}$$


So, the concentration decays inversely with time from the initial concentration of *A* to zero.
