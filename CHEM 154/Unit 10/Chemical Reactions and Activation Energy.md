# Chemical Reactions and Activation Energy

Chemical Reactions only occur when molecules and atoms interact with one another through collisions. For the collisions to be successful, 2 criterias have to be fulfilled:-
- Appropriate orientation, and
- Enough energy to break bonds

As *temperature increases*, *more collisions* occur between reactants with enough energy for the reaction to occur.
