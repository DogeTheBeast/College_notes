# Chemical Reactions

Chemical Reactions only occur when molecules and atoms interact with one another through collisions. For the collisions to be successful, 2 criterias have to be fulfilled:-
- Appropriate orientation (Collision Geometry), and
- Enough energy to break bonds (Activation Energy)

As *temperature increases*, *more collisions* occur between reactants with enough energy for the reaction to occur.

## Activation Energy (${E_a}$)

**Activation Energy** is the *minimum energy* that reactant molecules must possess to undergo a particular chemical reaction.

## Collision Geometry

Chemical reactions are also dependent on the way the molecules collide. For example,
