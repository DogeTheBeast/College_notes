# Chemical Reactions

Chemical Reactions only occur when molecules and atoms interact with one another through collisions. For the collisions to be successful, 2 criterias have to be fulfilled:-
- Appropriate orientation (Collision Geometry), and
- Enough energy to break bonds (Activation Energy)

As *temperature increases*, *more collisions* occur between reactants with enough energy for the reaction to occur.

## Activation Energy (${E_a}$)

**Activation Energy** is the *minimum energy* that reactant molecules must possess to undergo a particular chemical reaction.

## Collision Geometry

Chemical reactions are also dependent on the way the molecules collide. For example,

# Reaction Mechanisms

A reaction mechanism is a collection of one or more elementary steps that account for the way reactants become products. The sum of elementary steps in a mechanism gives the overall reaction. For example, consider the reaction,

$$\ce{NO2 (g) + CO (g) -> NO (g) + CO2 (g)}$$


The rate law for the reaction is,
$${ Rate  = k[NO_2]^2}$$

This reaction can be broken down into 2 steps,

$$\ce{NO2 (g) + NO2 (g) -> NO3 (g) + NO (g)}$$
$$\ce{NO3 (g) + CO (g) -> NO2 (g) + CO2 (g)}$$
which results in the net overall reaction,

$$\ce{NO2 (g) + CO (g) -> NO (g) + CO2 (g)}$$

$\ce{NO3}$ is an intermediate, An intermediate is a species that is not present in the reactants or proudcts but that is formed and consumed during the reaction.




# Arrhenius Behaviour

The **Arrhenius Equation** describes the relationship between the *rate constant (k)* and *temperature (T)*.

$${\LARGE ln(k) = \frac{-E_a}{R} \left (\frac{1}{T}\right) + ln(A)}$$

where,
- *k* is the rate constant,
- ${E_a}$ is the Activation Energy, and
- *A* is the frequency factor.
