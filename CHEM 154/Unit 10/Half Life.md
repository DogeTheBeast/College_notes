# Half Life

Half life is the amount of time that it takes for the concentration of a reactant to become *half* of its initial concentration. This is dependent upon 3 factors,

-  **Order of Reaction**,
-  **Rate Consant**,
-  **Initial Concentration** of the reactant.

$${\LARGE t_{1/2} = \frac{[A]_0}{2k}}$$
