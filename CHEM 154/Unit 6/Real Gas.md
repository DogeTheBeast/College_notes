# Real Gas

The real gas model assumes molecules do not interact. In the real gas model, molecules do have interactions. At high densities (high pressure), interactions start to have an effect and more accurate gas equations are needed, such as the virial equation or the Van Der Waal's equation.


## Van Der Waal's Equation

$${\LARGE (P + a (\frac{n}{V})^2 )(V-nb) = nRT}$$

where, *P* is the pressure of the gas,
*n* is the number of moles,
*V* is the volume of the gas,
*R* is the ideal gas constant,
*T* is the temperature of the gas, and
*a* and *b* are experimentally determined constant unique for each gas.

*b* is the volume occupied by 1 mole of the gas, and
