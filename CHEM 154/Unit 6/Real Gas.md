# Real Gas

The real gas model assumes molecules do not interact. In the real gas model, molecules do have interactions. At high densities (high pressure), interactions start to have an effect and more accurate gas equations are needed, such as the virial equation or the Van Der Waal's equation.


## Van Der Waal's Equation

$${\LARGE (P + a (\frac{n}{V})^2 )(V-nb) = nRT}$$
