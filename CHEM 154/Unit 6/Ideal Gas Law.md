## Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures

For a mixture of gases in a container of volume *V*, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas. Partial pressure is the pressure a gas would exert if it were alone.

$${\LARGE P_{total} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + ...}$$

$${\LARGE P_{total}V = (n_1 + n_2 + n_3 +...) RT}$$

## Mole Fraction

The mole fraction (*x*) is the ratio of the number of moles of a given component in a mixture to the total number of moles of the mixture.

$${\LARGE x_1 = \frac{}}
