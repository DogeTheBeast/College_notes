## Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures

For a mixture of gases in a container of volume *V*, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas. Partial pressure is the pressure a gas would exert if it were alone.

$${\LARGE P_{total} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + ...}$$

Because it is an ideal gas, the following can also be concluded about Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure (The identity does not matter, meaning that number of moles is directly related to pressure),

$${\LARGE P_{total}V = (n_1 + n_2 + n_3 +...) RT}$$

## Mole Fraction

The mole fraction (*x*) is the ratio of the number of moles of a given component in a mixture to the total number of moles of the mixture. The mole fraction is a value between 0 and 1.

$${\LARGE x_1 = \frac{n_1}{n_{total}} = \frac{n_1}{n_{1} + n_{2} +n_{3} +...}}$$

$${\LARGE x_1 = \frac{n_1}{n_{total}} = \frac{P_1}{P_{total}} =  \frac{V_1}{V_{total}}}$$


## Kinetic energy and Temperature

As temperature increases, the average speed (hence kinetic energy) increases, according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

### Gas identity

At fixed temperature, the identity of the gas affects the speed of the molecules.
