# Equilibrium Constant (*K*)

Chemical reactions are dynamic systems in  
which reactants are converted to products and  
products are converted to reactants.

The value of the equilibrium constant (*K*) tells us about the extent of the reaction,

- Small value of *K*; negligible product formation,
- Larger value of *K*; reaction practically goes to completion, no reactants left.
- Intermediate value of *K*; significant [Products] and [Reactants].

Consider the following reaction at equilibrium,

$${\LARGE aA + bB \rightarrow cC + dD}$$

The Equilibrium Constant can be calculated by doing,

$${\LARGE K = \frac{[C]^c \; [D]^d}{[A]^a \; [B]^b}}$$

The concentration can be replaced by the partial pressure ([[Ideal Gas Law (Chemistry)#^52a692]])as well as Activity.

# Reaction Quotient


The reaction quotient is similar to the equilibrium constant but it is calculated for non standard conditions. It uses the same equation,

$${\LARGE Q = \frac{[C]^c \; [D]^d}{[A]^a \; [B]^b}}$$

but the concentrations are for reactiants under non standard conditions.
