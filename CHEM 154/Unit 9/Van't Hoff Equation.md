# Van't Hoff Equation

Assuming that ${\Delta H^0}$ does not change with temperature, the **Van't Hodd Equation** gives the *Equilibrium Constant* at ${T_2}$ given its value at ${T_1}$.

$${\LARGE ln(\frac{K_2}{K_1}) = - \frac{\Delta H^0}{R} (\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac {1}{T_1})}$$


This equation can be plotted and understood as a ${y = mx + b}$ equation.
