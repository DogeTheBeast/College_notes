# Le Chatelier's Principle

"When a system at equilibrium is stressed, it responds by re-establishing equilibrium to reduce the applied stress."

The 3 common means of introducing such stresses are :-
- Change in concentration
- Change in Pressure
- Change in Temperature

## Change in Concentration

Consider the reaction where the concentration of A is increased,

$$\LARGE \ce{A + 2B <=> C + D}$$

According to Le Chatelier, the position of equilibrium will move in such a way as to **counteract the change**. That means that the position of equilibrium will move so that the concentration of A decreases again - by reacting it with B and turning it into C + D. The position of equilibrium moves to the right.

From this information, the following can be concluded,

`If t`
