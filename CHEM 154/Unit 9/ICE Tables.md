# ICE Tables


An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table is a simple matrix formalism that is used to simplify the calculations in reversible equilibrium reactions.

## Steps to making and using an ICE Table

Consider the following reaction,
$$\LARGE\ce{aA + bB <=> cC + dD}$$

From the equation of the reaction, the *Equilibrium Constant* ([[Equilibrium Constant and Reaction Quotient]]) can be determined by using the equation,

$${\LARGE K = \frac{[C]^c \; [D]^d}{[A]^a \; [B]^b}}$$

Then, make an ICE Table for the reaction (considering that the products have an initial concentration of 1 M for the example),

| Reaction               | *aA*   | *bB*   | *cC*   | *dD* |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---- |
| **Initial Amount**     | 1      | 1      | 1      | 1    |
| **Change in Amount**   | *-ax*  | *-ax*  | *+ax*  | *ax* |
| **Equilibrium Amount** | *1-ax* | *1-ax* | *1+ax* | *1+ax*     |


Using the value of *K*,

$${\LARGE K = \frac{(1+ax)(1+ax)}{(1-ax)(1-ax)}}$$

The equation above can be solved to determine the value of *x* and finally the *ICE Table* can be completed to determine the amount of the reactants and products at equilibrium.
