Chemical reactions are dynamic systems in  
which reactants are converted to products and  
products are converted to reactants.

The value of the equilibrium constant (*K*) tells us about the extent of the reaction,

- Small value of *K*; negligible product formation,
- Larger value of *K*; reaction practically goes to completion, no reactants left.
- Intermediate value of *K*; significant [Products] and [Reactants].
