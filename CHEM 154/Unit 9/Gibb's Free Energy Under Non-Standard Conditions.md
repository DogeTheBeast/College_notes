# Gibb's Free Energy Under Non-Standard Conditions

The Gibb's Free Energy can be calculated for reactions which are not under standard conditions by using the following equation,

$${\LARGE \Delta G_{rxn} = \Delta G^0 + RT
; ln(Q)}$$

Where *Q* is the Reaction Quotient ([[Equilibrium Constant and Reaction Quotient]]), and
${\Delta G^0}$ is the Standard [[Gibb's Free Energy]] for the reaction under standard conditions (1 M, 1 atm, etc.).
