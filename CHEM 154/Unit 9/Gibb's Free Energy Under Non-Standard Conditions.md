# Gibb's Free Energy Under Non-Standard Conditions

The Gibb's Free Energy can be calculated for reactions which are not under standard conditions by using the following equation,

$${\LARGE \Delta G_{rxn} = \Delta G^0 + RT
; ln(Q)}$$

Where *Q* is the Reaction Quotient ([[Equilibrium Constant and Reaction Quotient]]), and
${\Delta G^0}$ is the Standard [[Gibb's Free Energy]] for the reaction under standard conditions (1 M, 1 atm, etc.).

| ${\Delta G^0}$ | Direction of reaction            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Less than 0    | Spontaneous in forward direction |
| Equal to 0     | at Equilibrium                   |
| Greater than 0 | Spontaneous in reverse direction                                 |

## Relationship between *K* and ${\Delta G^0}$

When the system is at equilibrium,

$${\LARGE  \Delta G^0 = -RT\;ln(K)}$$
