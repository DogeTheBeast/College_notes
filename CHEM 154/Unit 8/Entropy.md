# Entropy

Entropy is the measure of how disorder a system is. For example, heat allows follows towards the surroundings from a coffee cup because as the entropy is higher when the heat is more dispersed with the surroundings.

$${\LARGE dS = \frac{dq}{T}}$$

where, *dS* is the change in the Entropy of the System,
${dq}$ is the change in the heat of the system, and
*T* is the temperature of the system.

## Probabilistic Interpretation of Entropy

$${\LARGE S = k\; ln(W)}$$

where, *S* is the entropy of the system,
*k* is ${\frac{R}{N_A} = 1.38 \times 10^{-23}\; JK^{-1}}$ which is the Boltzmann constant, and
*W* is the number of equivalent microscopic arrangements of the system. The greater the value of W, the greater the entropy of the system.


## Matter Dispersal (Understanding Entropy)

There are more states with equivalent dispersion of particles. Hence, those states are more likely to exists, and therefore, they occur more often and have a greater entropy.

## Quantities related to increase in Entropy

Entropy increases when :-

- Increasing temperature (adding heat (*Q*))
- Increasing system volume
- Phase transition to higher entrotpy species
- Increasing number of products
- Increasing complexity of products
- Producing higher entropy species in a reaction (solid to liquid to gas)

## Second Law of Thermodynamics

The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the state of entropy of the entire universe, as an isolated system, will always increase over time.


$${\LARGE \Delta S_{Universe} = \Delta S_{Surr} + \Delta S_{System} \geq 0}$$

${\Delta S}$ can be positive or negative but ${\Delta S_{Surr}}$ must compensate so that ${\Delta S_{Universe}}$ is never negative.


${\Delta S_{Universe} = 0}$, only if all processes are reversible.


## For reversible reaction

$${\LARGE S_F = S_I}$$
where, ${S_F}$ is the final entropy of the system, and
${S_I}$ is the initial entropy of the system.

As the reaction is reversible, the final state is not preferred over the initial state and therefore, the reaction can go both ways.

## For irreversible reaction

$${\LARGE S_F > S_I}$$
where, ${S_F}$ is the final entropy of the system, and
${S_I}$ is the initial entropy of the system.

As the reaction is irreversible, the final state has a greater entropy than the initial state. Therefore, the final state is preferred over the initial state and therefore, the reaction can moves towards the final state.


## Standard Molar Entropy (${S_m^o}$)

Standard Molar Entropy is a state function. It is the entropy of one mole of substance under standard state conditions. Its units are  ${J\; K^{-1}\; mol^{-1}}$.

$${\LARGE \Delta S^o = \sum v_p \cdot S_m^o (products) - \sum v_p \cdot S_m^o (products)}
