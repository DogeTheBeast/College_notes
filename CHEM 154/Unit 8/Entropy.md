# Entropy

Entropy is the 

$${\LARGE dS = \frac{dq_{rev}{T}}$$

where, *dS* is the change in the Entropy of the System,
${dq_{rev}}$ is the change in the heat of the system (Only for reversible reactions), and
*T* is the temperature of the system.

### For Isothermal Process

$${\LARGE \Delta S = \frac{q_{rev}{T}}$$
