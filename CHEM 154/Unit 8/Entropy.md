# Entropy

Entropy is the measure of how disorder a system is. For example, heat allows follows towards the surroundings from a coffee cup because as the entropy is higher when the heat is more dispersed with the surroundings.

## Second Law of Thermodynamics





## For reversible reaction
$${\LARGE dS = \frac{dq_{rev}{T}}$$

where, *dS* is the change in the Entropy of the System,
${dq_{rev}}$ is the change in the heat of the system (Only for reversible reactions), and
*T* is the temperature of the system.

$${\LARGE S_F = S_I}$$
where, ${S_F}$ is the final entropy

### For Isothermal Process

$${\LARGE \Delta S = \frac{q_{rev}{T}}$$
