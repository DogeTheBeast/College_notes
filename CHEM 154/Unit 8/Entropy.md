# Entropy

Entropy is the measure of how disorder a system is. For example, heat allows follows towards the surroundings from a coffee cup because as the entropy is higher when the heat is more dispersed with the surroundings.

$${\LARGE dS = \frac{dq}{T}}$$

where, *dS* is the change in the Entropy of the System,
${dq}$ is the change in the heat of the system, and
*T* is the temperature of the system.



## Second Law of Thermodynamics

The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the state of entropy of the entire universe, as an isolated system, will always increase over time.


$${\LARGE \Delta S_{Universe} = \Delta S_{Surr} + \Delta S_{System} \geq 0}$$

${\Delta S}$ can be positive or negative but ${\Delta S_{Surr}}$ must compensate so that ${\Delta S_{Universe}}$ is never negative.


${\Delta S_{Universe}}}


## For reversible reaction

$${\LARGE S_F = S_I}$$
where, ${S_F}$ is the final entropy of the system, and
${S_I}$ is the initial entropy of the system.

As the reaction is reversible, the final state is not preferred over the initial state and therefore, the reaction can go both ways.

## For irreversible reaction

$${\LARGE S_F > S_I}$$
where, ${S_F}$ is the final entropy of the system, and
${S_I}$ is the initial entropy of the system.

As the reaction is irreversible, the final state has a greater entropy than the initial state. Therefore, the final state is preferred over the initial state and therefore, the reaction can moves towards the final state.



### For Isothermal Process

$${\LARGE \Delta S = \frac{q_{rev}}{T}}$$
