# Gibb's Free Energy

Gibb's Free Energy is defined as the energy available to the system to do work. More formally, Gibb's Free Energy is a thermodynamic potential that can be used to calculate the maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum "Maximum") reversible [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") that may be performed by a [thermodynamic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_system "Thermodynamic system") at a constant [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") and [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure").
