# Gibb's Free Energy

Gibb's Free Energy is defined as the energy available to the system to do work. More formally, Gibb's Free Energy is a thermodynamic potential that can be used to calculate the maximum reversible work that may be performed by a thermodynamic system at a constant temperature and pressure. 

$${\LARGE G = H - T S}$$

And at constant pressure and temperature,
$${\LARGE \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S}$$

Gibb's Free Energy can be used to determine the spontaneity of a process. Hence, the spontaneity of a process is determined by the entropy and the enthalpy of the reaction.

$${\LARGE \Delta G = -T \Delta S_{Universe}}$$

which leads us to the conclusion,
- if ${\Delta G <0}$, the reaction is spontaneous,
- if ${\Delta G = 0}$, the reaction is at equilibrium,
- if ${\Delta G > 0}$, the reaction is non-spontaneous.

## Driving force of a reaction

Reactions can be
- 'driven by enthalpy' (where a very exothermic reaction (negative ΔH) overcomes a decrease in entropy) or,
- 'driven by entropy' where an endothermic reaction occurs because of a highly positive ΔS.

For Example,

The formation of NaCl(s) from its elements is spontaneous and releases a great deal of heat.

$${\LARGE Na(s) + Cl_2 (g) \rightarrow 2NaCl(s)}$$

- This process involves a gas molecule becoming a solid, and therefore must involve a decrease in entropy. Therefore, ΔS is negative.
-  It is an exothermic reaction, releasing heat, therefore ΔH must also be negative.
-   This reaction is 'driven by enthalpy', because the large negative ΔH is more negative than the -TΔS term is positive, resulting in a negative overall ΔG and a spontaneous reaction.

Below is a table that relates the sign of the entropy and the enthalpy of a reaction to Gibb's Free Energy,

| ${\Delta H}$ | ${\Delta S}$ | ${\Delta G}$                                        |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| -            | +            | Spontaneous                                         |
| +            | -            | Non-Spontaneous                                     |
| -            | -            | Spontaneous at low *T*, Non-Spontaneous at High *T* |
| +            | +            | Non-Spontaneous at low *T*, Spontaneous at high *T* |

## Standard Gibb's Free Energy of formation (${G_f°}$)

The standard Gibbs free energy of formation (${G_f°}$) of a compound is the change of Gibbs free energy that accompanies the formation of 1 mole of a substance in its standard state from its constituent elements in their standard states (the most stable form of the element at 1 bar of pressure and the specified temperature, usually 298.15 K or 25 °C).

The Standard Gibb's Free Energy of formation for elements in reference form (the stablest form (physical state and allotrope) of the element under standard thermodynamic conditions) is 0.

$${\LARGE \Delta G^0 = \sum v_p \cdot \Delta G_f^0 (products) - \sum v_r \cdot \Delta G_f^0 (reactants)}$$

meaning,

$${\LARGE \Delta G^0 = \Delta H^0 - T \Delta S^0}$$
