# Gibb's Free Energy

Gibb's Free Energy is defined as the energy available to the system to do work. More formally, Gibb's Free Energy is a thermodynamic potential that can be used to calculate the maximum reversible work that may be performed by a thermodynamic system at a constant temperature and pressure. 

$${\LARGE G = H - T S}$$

And at constant pressure and temperature,
$${\LARGE \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S}$$

Gibb's Free Energy can be used to determine the spontaneity of a process. Hence, the spontaneity of a process is determined by the entropy and the enthalpy of the reaction.

$${\LARGE \Delta G = -T \Delta S_{Universe}}$$

which leads us to the conclusion,
- if ${\Delta G <0}$ the reaction is
