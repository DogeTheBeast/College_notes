# Orbitals

The quantum mechanical model of an atom or molecule states that the position of an [[electron]] cannot be known with absolute certainty. For this reason, the position of an electron is presented as a probability distribution which we describe using orbitals. Orbitals are the regions in space where [electrons] can be found in a higher probability. 

The orbital number (N) is the period number.

There are 4 types of sub orbitals 

- S which can hold 2 electrons
- P which can hold 6 electrons
- D which can hold 10 electrons
- F which can hold 14 electrons

So, if N = 1, the total number of electrons it can hold is 2. If N = 2, that shell can hold 2 (in s) and 6 (in p), a total of 8. This goes on for N = 3, 4 and so on.
