# Orbitals

The quantum mechanical model of an atom or molecule states that the position of an [[electron]] cannot be known with absolute certainty. For this reason, the position of an electron is presented as a probability distribution which we describe using orbitals. Orbitals are the regions in space where [electrons] can be found in a higher probability.

There are 4 types of orbitals 

- S orbi
- P
- D
- F
