# Fundamental Particles

An atom is made up of 3 types of particles. 
- Electrons
- Protons
- Neutrons

## Electron
Electron is the negatively charged particle which surrounds the nucleus by orbiting around it in different [[Orbitals]]. It is denoted by *e* and has a relative charge of -1. It has negligible mass.

## Proton
To balance out the charge of the electron, there exists a particle called proton which has and equal and opposite charge to the charge of an electron but does not have negligible mass. Protons are located inside the nucleus along with neutrons.

## Neutron
Neutrons are the only particles without any charge present on them and only have mass as their property. The have the same mass as protons and are located inside the nucleus.

## Properties of Elementary particles

| Name of particle | Charge (in Columbs)          | Mass                        | 
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Electron         | ${-1.60217662 × 10^{-19} C}$ | ${9.10938356 × 10^{-31}kg}$ |
| Proton           | ${1.60217662 × 10^{-19} C}$  | ${1.6726219 × 10^{-27} kg}$ |
| Neutron          | ${0}$                        | ${1.6726219 × 10^{-27} kg}$ |

# Atomic Number and Mass Number

![[Mass and atomic number.jpg]]

## Atomic Number (Z)
Atomic number is the number of protons present inside an atom of an element. It is denoted by *Z* and is useful in understanding the reactivity of the element.

## Mass Number (A)
Mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons present inside an atom of an element. It is denoted by *A* and is used in the formula,

$${\LARGE N = A - Z}$$

where, *N* is the Number of neutrons present.

### Nuclide 
Nuclide refers to the any particular kind of nucleus. For example, a nucleus of atomic number 7 is a nuclide of nitrogen. 


# Atomic Mass Unit

It is 1/12 of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of [[Carbon]]-12 in its nuclear and electronic [ground state] and at rest.

It is denoted by u and is roughly equal to 

${\LARGE 1 amu = 1.66053906660 \times 10^{−27} kg}$.

Therefore the mass of 1 [[Carbon]] atom is 12 times the mass of the amu and the mass of all other elements is with reference to the mass of the [[Carbon]]-12 atom.

# Isotopes

Isotopes are elements with the same atomic Number but different mass number. This means that they have a different number of neutrons but same number of protons.

# Mass Spectroscopy

It is the process of measuring the mass of an element by accelerating the atoms and them looking at how much they deflect in a magnetic field.

1. First, electrons are removed from or added to atoms or molecules, thus producing charged particles called ions. 
2. When an electric field is applied, the ions are accelerated into a separate chamber where they are deflected from their initial trajectory by a magnetic field, like the electrons in Thomson’s experiment.
3.   The extent of the deflection depends on the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion. By measuring the relative deflection of ions that have the same charge, scientists can determine their relative masses.
