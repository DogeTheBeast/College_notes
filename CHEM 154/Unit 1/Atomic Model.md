# Fundamental Particles

An atom is made up of 3 types of particles. 
- Electrons
- Protons
- Neutrons

## Electron
Electron is the negatively charged particle which surrounds the nucleus by orbiting around it in different [[Orbitals]]. It is denoted by *e* and has a relative charge of -1. It has negligible mass.

## Proton
To balance out the charge of the electron, there exists a particle called proton which has and equal and opposite charge to the charge of an electron but does not have negligible mass. Protons are located inside the nucleus along with neutrons.

## Neutron
Neutrons are the only particles without any charge present on them and only have mass as their property. The have the same mass as protons and are located inside the nucleus.

## Properties of Elementary particles

| Name of particle | Charge (in Columbs)          | Mass                        | 
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Electron         | ${-1.60217662 × 10^{-19} C}$ | ${9.10938356 × 10^{-31}kg}$ |
| Proton           | ${1.60217662 × 10^{-19} C}$  | ${1.6726219 × 10^{-27} kg}$ |
| Neutron          | ${0}$                        | ${1.6726219 × 10^{-27} kg}$ |

# Atomic Number and Mass Number

![[mass]]

## Atomic Number (Z)
Atomic number is the number of protons present inside an atom of an element. It is denoted by *Z* and is useful in understanding the reactivity of the element.

## Mass Number (A)
Mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons present inside an atom of an element. It is denoted by *A* and is used in the formula,

$${\LARGE Number_of_Neutrons = A - Z}$$

### Nuclide 
Nuclide refers to the any particular kind of nucleus. For example, a nucleus of atomic number 7 is a nuclide of nitrogen.
