# Effective Nuclear Charge

Effective nuclear charge is the nuclear charge experienced by [[Valence Electrons]]. The effective nuclear charge is less than the actual nuclear charge due to the [[electron shielding]] effect of the core electrons.

It is a theoretical value which is calculated by subtracting the electron shielding effect from the acutal nuclear charge experienced by the valence electrons.

${Z_{eff} = Z-S}$

where,
${Z_{eff}}$ = effective nuclear charge
Z = Number of protons in the nucleus (atomic number)
S = Shielding constant
