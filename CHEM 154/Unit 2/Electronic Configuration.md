# Electronic Configuration

The [[electrons]] in the atom are arranged in [[Orbitals]] while following a specific set of rules. These rules or principles are listed are :-

## Pauli Exclusion Principle
Maximum of 2 electrons can be assigned to any one orbital and the electrons must have opposite spins.
## Aufbau Principle
Electrons fill the orbital with the lowest energy first. Aufbau principle states that the electrons are added one at a time to the lowest-energy orbital available.

The order the orbitals are filled in is displayed above.

### Exception

The 3d oribital has less energy than 4s orbital for atomic number less than 30. Hence, when the option is available, chromium and copper

Chromium - ${[Ar] 4s^1 3d^5}$
Copper - ${[Ar] 4s^1 3d^{10}}$
