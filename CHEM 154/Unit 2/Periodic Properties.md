# Periodic Properties

## Atomic Radius

Atomic radius is directly related to the amount of electrons that are present in an atom. It increases down the group and decreases across the period.

### Isoelectronic 

Isoelectic atoms are atoms and ions with the same number electrons but different [[Atomic Number]] and mass number. 

### At
In a set of isoelectronic species, the most negative species has the largest radius.

## Effective Nuclear Charge (${Z_{eff}}$)


Effective nuclear charge is the nuclear charge experienced by [[Valence Electrons]]. The effective nuclear charge is less than the actual nuclear charge due to the [[electron shielding]] effect of the core electrons.

It is a theoretical value which is calculated by subtracting the electron shielding effect from the acutal nuclear charge experienced by the valence electrons.

${Z_{eff} = Z-S}$

where,
${Z_{eff}}$ = effective nuclear charge
Z = Number of protons in the nucleus (atomic number)
S = Shielding constant

## Ionization Energy


Ionization energy is the minimum energy required to remove a single electrons from an atom, molecule or ion in its gaseous state.

${X-> X^+ + e^-}$
														
Fluorine has the highest ionization energy because it has the greatest [[Effective Nuclear Charge]] meaning that it is difficult to remove electrons from fluorine. Noble gases have the highest ionization energy because they have a stable octet and don't want to lose any electrons.

## Electron Affinity


Electron affinity is the energy change resulting from the addition of a single electron to an atom or molecule in its gaseous state.

${X(g) + e^- -> X^- (g)}$

[[alkali earth metal]] do not form stable anions. 
[[halogen]] have an electron affinity of zero because they don't want to accept any electrons.

(Pay attention to the sign on the Y axis)


The negative sign means that that element wants electrons.
Fluorine has the most negative electron affinity.

## Electronegativity

Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract shared electrons to itself in a chemical bond. 

**Greater Electronegativity = Greater electron affinity**

It is not an atomic property because it refers to atoms in a bond and it is a calculated value, not measured. The greater the electronegativity, the more polar a compound is.
