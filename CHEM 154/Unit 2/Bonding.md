# Bonding

Bonds are the most stable when they have the least energy.

## Bond Energies and Bond Orders


When a bond is formed, energy is released (exothermic process).The bond energy is the energy required to break a covalent bond, and the bond order is the number of electron pairs shared by two atoms in a covalent bond.The lattice energy is the energy required to dissociate an ionic solid into its separate ions, and increases with the charges on the ions or as the distance between charges decreases.
