# Aufbau Principle

Aufbau principle states that the electrons are added one at a time to the lowest-energy orbital available.

The order the orbitals are filled in is displayed above.

## Exception

The 3d oribital has less energy than 4s orbital for atomic number less than 30. Hence, when the option is available, chromium and copper

Chromium - ${4s^1 3d^5}$
Copper - ${4s^1 3d^10}$
