# Ionization Energy

Ionization energy is the minimum energy required to remove a single electrons from an atom, molecule or ion in its gaseous state.

${X-> X^+ + e^-}$
														
Fluorine has the highest ionization energy because it has the greatest [[Effective Nuclear Charge]] meaning that it is difficult to remove electrons from fluorine.
