# Electron Affinity

Electron affinity is the energy change resulting from the addition of a single electron to an atom or molecule in its gaseous state.

${X(g) + e^- -> X^- (g)}$

[[alkali earth metal]] do not form stable anions. 
[[halogen]] have an electron affinity of zero because they don't want to accept any electrons.

(Pay attention to the sign on the Y axis)


The negative sign means that that element wants electrons.
Fluorine has the most negative electron affinity.
