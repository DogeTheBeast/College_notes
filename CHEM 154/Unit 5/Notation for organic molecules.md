# Notation for organic molecules

- Covalent bonds are drawn as lines.
- The end of each line indicates a carbon atom, unless otherwise specified.
- Each carbon atom has enough bonde H atoms to give it a formal charge of zero.
- Hydrogen atoms are only shown if they are bonded to an atom other than carbon.
- Lone pairs can be omitted.
