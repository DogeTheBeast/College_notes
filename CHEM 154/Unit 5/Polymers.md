# Polymers
A polymer is a macromolecule constructed by a sequential stringing together of smaller molecules called monomers.

## Types of Polymers

### Condensation polymers

#### Amide Linkage
- Two monomers join together to form a polymer and a small molecule byproduct (water or hydrochloric acid).
- Condensation monomers have two reactive sites.
- An amide linkage is formed when carboxylic acids or an acid chloride react with amines.
- The amide linkage repeats along backbone of polymer.
