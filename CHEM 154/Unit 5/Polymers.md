# Polymers
A polymer is a macromolecule constructed by a sequential stringing together of smaller molecules called monomers.

## Types of Polymers

### Condensation polymers
Two monomers join together to form a polymer and a small molecule byproduct (water or hydrochloric acid).

#### Amide Linkage
- Condensation monomers have two reactive sites.
- An amide linkage is formed when carboxylic acids or an acid chloride react with amines.
- The amide linkage repeats along backbone of polymer.

#### Ester Linkage
- An ester linkage is formed when carboxylic acid or an acid chloride reacts with alcohols.
- The ester linkage repeats along the backbone of the polymer.

### Addition polymers
Addition reactions occue when two or more molecules join to form a larger molecule **without** the loss of any atoms/small molecules.

The steps can be broken down into 3 major steps.

#### Initiation - Number of radicals increases

#### Propogation - Number of radicals remains constant

#### Termination - Number of radicals decreases
