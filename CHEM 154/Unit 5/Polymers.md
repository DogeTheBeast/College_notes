# Polymers
A polymer is a macromolecule constructed by a sequential stringing together of smaller molecules called monomers.

## Types of Polymers

### Condensation polymers
Two monomers join together to form a polymer and a small molecule byproduct (water or hydrochloric acid).

#### Amide Linkage
- Condensation monomers have two reactive sites.
- An amide linkage is formed when carboxylic acids or an acid chloride react with amines.
- The amide linkage repeats along backbone of polymer.

#### Ester Linkage
- An ester linkage is formed when carboxylic acid or an acid chloride reacts with alcohols.
- The ester linkage repeats along the backbone of the polymer.

### Addition polymers
Addition reactions occue when two or more molecules join to form a larger molecule **without** the loss of any atoms/small molecules.

The steps can be broken down into 3 major steps.

#### Initiation - Number of radicals increases

Initiation is the process of generating a free radical by removing one electron from a compound. Radicals are generally abbreviated as ${R \cdot}$, where the dot represents the unpaired electron.

Examples of Initiaors includes,

#### Propogation - Number of radicals remains constant

In propogation, a growing chain reacts with a monomeric unit, extending the length of the polymer. No overall change in number of radical species.

#### Termination - Number of radicals decreases

Termination is when the number of free radicals decreases and the polymer chain stops growing. This happens when 2 polymer chains meet or a polymer chain meets with an initiator.

## Degree of polymerization

Degree of polymerization (DP) is the number of repeating units in a polymer chain. For example,

| Structure | DP    |
| --------- | ----- |
| Dimer     | 2     |
| Trimer    | 3     |
| Tetramer  | 4     |
| Pentamer  | 5     |
| Oligomer  | Small |
| Polymer   | Large |
