# Atomic Mass Unit

It is 1/12 of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of [Carbon]-12 in its nuclear and electronic [ground state] and at rest.

It is denoted by u and is roughly equal to 1.66053906660(50)×10−27 kg.

Therefore the mass of 1 carbon atom is 12 times the mass of the amu and the mass of all other elements is with reference to the mass of the carbon
