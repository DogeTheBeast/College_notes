# Mass Spectroscopy

It is the process of measuring the mass of an element by accelerating the atoms and them looking at how much they deflect in a magnetic field.

1. First, electrons are removed from or added to atoms or molecules, thus producing charged particles called ions. 

When an electric field is applied, the ions are accelerated into a separate chamber where they are deflected from their initial trajectory by a magnetic field, like the electrons in Thomsonâ€™s experiment. The extent of the deflection depends on the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion. Bymeasuring the relative deflection of ions that have the same charge, scientistscan determine their relative masses
