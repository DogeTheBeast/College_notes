# Work
Work is the energy transferred between system and the surroundings attributable to a force times a distance (in general sense). 

$${\LARGE W = Fd cos(\theta)}$$

where *W* is the work done,
*F* is the force applied on the system,
*d* is the distance that the system has been shifted, and
${\theta}$ is the angle between the moment of the system and the direction of the force applied.

## Pressure and volume
The work done at a constant pressure with a change in the volume. The equation is,
$${\LARGE }
