# Heat Capacity
There are 2 types of heat capacity :-

## Molar heat capacity
It is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 mole of a substance by 1 degree or 1 kelvin. The formula is,

$${\LARGE Q = n \times C_{p,m} \times \delta T}$$
 
 where *Q* is the energy required,
 *n* is the number of moles,
 ${C_{p,m}}$ is the molar heat capacity
