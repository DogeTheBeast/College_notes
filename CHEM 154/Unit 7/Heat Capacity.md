# Heat Capacity
It is the quantity of heat required to change the temperature of a substance (without phase change occuring). There are 2 types of heat capacity under constant pressure :-

## Molar heat capacity
It is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 mole of a substance by 1 degree or 1 kelvin. The formula is,

$${\LARGE Q = n \times C_{p,m} \times \Delta T}$$
 
 where *Q* is the energy required,
 *n* is the number of moles,
 ${C_{p,m}}$ is the molar heat capacity, and 
 ${\delta}$ is the change in temperature of the substance.
 
 ## Specific heat capacity
 
 It is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 g of a substance by 1 degree or 1 kelvin. The formula is,

$${\LARGE Q = m \times C_{p} \times \delta T}$$
 
 where *Q* is the energy required,
 *m* is the mass of the substance,
 ${C_{p}}$ is the specific heat capacity, and 
 ${\delta}$ is the change in temperature of the substance.
