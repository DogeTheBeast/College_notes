# Thermodynamics first law
The first law of thermodynamics states that the energy in the universe is conserved.

$${\LARGE Universe = System + Surroundings}$$

This can also be written as 

$${\LARGE \delta U = Q-W}$$
where ${\delta U}$ is the change in internal energy,
*Q* is the energy supplied to the system, and 
*W* is the work done by the system on its surroundings.
