## Isochoric process
Isochoric processes are processes which occur with constant volume.

$${\LARGE \Delta V = 0}$$

$${\LARGE W = 0}$$
$${\LARGE q = \Delta U}$$

# Isobaric process
Isobaric processes are processes which occur with constant pressure.

$${\LARGE Q = \Delta U + W}$$
$${\LARGE Q = n C_p \Delta T}$$
$${\LARGE \Delta U = n C_v \Delta T}$$
$${\LARGE W = P \Delta V = n R \Delta T}$$
