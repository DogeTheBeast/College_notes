# Enthalpy
![[First Law of Thermodynamics]]


## Isochoric process
Isochoric processes are processes which occur with constant volume.

$${\LARGE \Delta V = 0}$$

$${\LARGE W = 0}$$
$${\LARGE q = \Delta U}$$

## Isobaric process
Isobaric processes are processes which occur with constant pressure.

$${\LARGE q = \Delta U - W}$$
$${\LARGE W = - P \Delta V}$$
$${\LARGE q = \Delta U + P \Delta V = \Delta H}$$
where ${\Delta H}$ is the change in enthalpy.

## Endothermic and Exothermic processes

If a reaction is endothermic, 

$${q_p >0}$$
$${\Delta H >0}$$

If a reaction is exothermic,

$${q_p<0}$$
$${\Delta H<0}$$


## Hess' Law

Hess' Law states that the sum of ${\Delta H}$ for all steps gives the overall reaction enthalpy.

$${\LARGE \Delta H = \Delta H_1 +\Delta H_2 +\Delta H_3}$$


## Standard Enthalpy of Formation

Standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change in a reaction where 1 mole of substance is formed from elements in their standard states.

$${\LARGE \Delta H^o_{f,T}}$$

The requirements for the enthalpy change to be standard enthalpy of formation are,

- Gases are at 1 atm (101325 Pa).
- Solutions are at 1 Molar concentration.

Standard Enthalpy of formation for elements in standard states (at room temperature and pressure and only 1 mole) is 0.

$${\Delta H^o}
