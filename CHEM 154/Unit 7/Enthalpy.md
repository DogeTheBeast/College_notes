## Isochoric process
Isochoric processes are processes which occur with constant volume.

$${\LARGE \Delta V = 0}$$

$${\LARGE W = 0}$$
$${\LARGE q = \Delta U}$$

# Isobaric process
Isobaric processes are processes which occur with constant pressure.


$${\LARGE q = \Delta U - W}$$
$${\LARGE W = - P \Delta V}$$
$${\LARGE }
