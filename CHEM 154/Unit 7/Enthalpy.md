## Isochoric process
Isochoric processes are processes which occur with constant volume.

$${\LARGE \Delta V = 0}$$

$${\LARGE W = 0}$$
$${\LARGE q = \Delta U}$$

## Isobaric process
Isobaric processes are processes which occur with constant pressure.

$${\LARGE q = \Delta U - W}$$
$${\LARGE W = - P \Delta V}$$
$${\LARGE q = \Delta U + P \Delta V = \Delta H}$$
where ${\Delta H}$ is the change in enthalpy.

## Endothermic and Exothermic processes

If a reaction is endothermic, 

$${q_p >0}$$
$${\Delta H >0}$$

If a reaction is exothermic,

$${q_p<0}$$
$${\Delta H<0}$$
