# Thermodynamics first law
The first law of thermodynamics states that the energy in the universe is conserved.

$${\LARGE Universe = System + Surroundings}$$

## In Chemistry

$${\LARGE \Delta U = q+W}$$
where ${\Delta U}$ is the change in internal energy,
*q* is the energy supplied to the system, and 
*W* is the work done by the system on its surroundings.

## In Physics
$${\LARGE \Delta U = Q-W}$$
where ${\Delta U}$ is the change in internal energy,
*Q* is the energy supplied to the system, and 
*W* is the work done by the system on its surroundings.
