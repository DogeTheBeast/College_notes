# Types of Intermolecular forces

There are 5 types of intermolecular forces that exist between molecules.

## London Dispersion Forces
Also known as instantaneous dipole-induced dipole forces, they exist between all atoms and molecules, and are always attractive. Arise from a momentary asymmetry in electron density caused by charge fluctuations.

London dispersion forces are based on the polarizability of the molecule. The greater the polarizability (meaning that it has more weakly bound or delocalized electrons), the greater the force of london dispersion

### Hydrocarbons
- Larger molecules have a greater number of polarizable atoms that contribute to making the total dispersion larger.

- Branching within a molecule reduces the possibilities for intermolecular interactions and lowers the melting points.

## Dipole-Dipole Forces
Dipole-Dipole forces are intermolecular interactions in which polar molecules have forces between them because of the difference in electronegativity.

## Hydrogen Bonding

A strong dipole-dipole force in molecules with a hydrogen atom bonded to an electronegative atom (N, O, or F).
