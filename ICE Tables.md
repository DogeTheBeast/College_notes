# ICE Tables


An ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table is a simple matrix formalism that is used to simplify the calculations in reversible equilibrium reactions.

## Steps to making and using an ICE Table

Consider the following reaction,
$$\LARGE\ce{aA + bB <=> cC + dD}$$

From the equation of the reaction, the *Equilibrium Constant* can be determined.
